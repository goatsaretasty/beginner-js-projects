# Beginner JS projects
This repository is the sequel to the [First Timers Night](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/front-end-community/blob/master/first-timers-guides/first_timers_javascript_guide.md) for Women Who Code. Each folder contains a sample project that can be worked on, along with the following contents for each project:
* Starter HTML/CSS template files (can be modified for your own project but please give credit)
* Required functionality for the project (aka "To Dos")
* Expected outcomes - screenshots displaying all possible outputs of the given project
* Extra functionality/ideas you can incorporate into the project (aka "Dazzlers")

While all of these projects can be worked on individually, the intent is that any one of these projects will be taught during a front end lab night as a supplement to the first timers nights.

## Getting Started
1. _Download_ the repo. Clone the repo to your local if you have Git, or download the repo if you don't (see screenshot below):

2. _Read_ the project's `README.md` file for more information on the project.
3. _Create a new JS file_ in the project folder you wish to work in and add your code there. Be sure to [link your JS file](https://github.com/womenwhocodedc/front-end-community/blob/master/first-timers-guides/first_timers_javascript_guide.md#external-javascript-file---mainjs) to the index page!
4. _View your changes_ by double clicking on the `index.html` file of the project you're working on within your computer's file viewer (Finder on Mac, Windows Explorer on Windows).
5. _Refresh the page_ anytime you change something for the project if you want to see the differences.

That's all there is to it!

## Stuck on a problem?
Check to make sure the mistake isn't one of the following:
* Missing brackets/semi-colons/tags
* Incorrect variable names (`myvar` is not the same as `myVar`)
* Other [Syntax errors](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13391/syntax-error)

If the problem isn't a syntax error (or you're not sure if it is), searching online is your best friend. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a great resource for general documentation, while [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is great for very specific code questions.

If all else fails, another branch `marian-answers` has the completed JS files. Or [create an issue on this repo](https://github.com/mmlumba/beginner-js-projects/issues/new) if you think I'm missing something.
